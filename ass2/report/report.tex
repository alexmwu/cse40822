It took 79.347 seconds to run comparisons of a snippet of agambiae.small.fasta with 7 other snippets of agambiae.small.fasta. Given this, approximately 5.293 comparisons can be made in one minute. In order to compare every sequence to every other sequence sequentially, for n sequences, it would take (n-1)*n/2 comparisons divided by 5.293 comparisons per minute for 5880.408 minutes. In order to complete this job in one hour, it would take approximately 98.007 machines or 99 machines. The snippet given only contains 250 sequences. The complete a.gambiae data contains 100,000 sequences. Using the same formula, this would take 94463442.823 minutes on one machine, which is equal to 15743907.047 hours = 655996.127 days = 1797.250 years.
