It took 79.347 seconds to run comparisons of a snippet of agambiae.small.fasta with 7 other snippets of agambiae.small.fasta. Given this, approximately 5.293 comparisons can be made in one minute. In order to compare every sequence to every other sequence sequentially, it would take 11808.048 minutes. In order to complete this job in one hour, it would take approximately 196.801 machines or 197 machines. The snippet given only contains 250 sequences. The complete a.gambiae data contains 100,000 sequences. This would take 1889287738.523 minutes on one machine, which is equal to 31488128.975 hours = 1312005.374 days = 3594.535 years.
